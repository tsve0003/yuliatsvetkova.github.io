<h3 class="s-59a49b80">Concept and proceedings</h3>
<ul id="l4">
<li>
<div class="s-9b1cd2a7"><!-- Left Column -->
<div class="s-b4dcbecf">
<p>The Group of Seven or G7 refers to a group of seven countries [1] whose <strong>leaders meet informally, once a year</strong>. These seven countries are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. The European Union is also represented at these meetings and has been since 1978.</p>
</div>
<!-- Right Column -->
<div class="s-f2be473c">
<p class="s-af1cefbe"><strong>European Union:</strong> A voluntary association of 28 European countries in the economic and political fields that focuses on guaranteeing peace in Europe and ensuring economic and political stability.</p>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the leaders of these countries, the objectives of these meetings are <strong>to discuss international issues</strong> and to come to an agreement on <strong>shared commitments</strong> related to the host country’s targeted themes. Canada is the host country this year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every year, <strong>one of the country members is the president of the group and hosts a teo - or three day meeting in its territory</strong>. <strong>The country that is the president announces major themes</strong> that make up the agenda to be addressed over the course of that year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To prepare for the annual meeting, the host country holds <strong>preparatory meetings with advisers from each government</strong> and ministerial meetings, prior to the summit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the end of the meetings, the G7 issues <strong>a final statement summarizing the countries’ commitments</strong> related to the themes that were discussed. The decisions outlined in this joint statement are <strong>made consensually, so all of all the members have agreed on them</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During G7 summits, non-G7 countries and international organizations are invited to join in some of the discussions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="s-6cfe161a">Creation of the G7</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In 1973 and 1974, informal meetings, referred to as the G4 and G5, were held between the finance ministers of 5 countries: <strong>France, Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom and West Germany</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first “official” meeting was the initiative of <strong>French President</strong> <strong>Valéry Giscard d’Estaing in 1975 and German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt</strong>. Noting the success of the previous meetings between finance ministers, they wanted to hold similar meetings between leaders so they could discuss major global economic issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Originally, these informal meetings were held to lessen the effects of t<strong>he economic crisis caused by the oil shock of the 1970s</strong> and were designed as <strong>a venue to discuss economic policy</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="s-6cfe161a">Topics Discussed</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The G7 was initially designed to be a <strong>forum for diplomatic economic discussions</strong> aimed at addressing <strong>economic and monetary policy issues</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over the years, <strong>the themes discussed have diversified</strong> to include security, immigration, climate change and development assistance, among others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="s-6cfe161a">Mock G7 Themes</h3>
<p>Canada has not yet announced its themes for the G7 Summit in Kananaskis. For the Student Model G7, the themes will be the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Preparing for jobs of the future in the global context</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Working together for the environment </strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Building a more peaceful and secure world</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>G7, G8, G20... <strong>What’s the difference?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The G7 is the Group of Seven countries, plus the European Union.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The G8 is the G7 countries plus Russia. </strong>This group existed from 1998 to 2014.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The G20 was created in 1999 to bring together the finance ministers of 19 countries plus the European Union. Since 2008, it has been these countries’ leaders who meet</strong> to address issues related to the financial crisis that affects them:</p>

<h3 class="s-6cfe161a">Canada's Place</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Canada joined the G7 in <strong>1976</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has already hosted this event <strong>six times :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In 1981 (Montebello, Quebec/Ottawa, Ontario)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 1988 (Toronto, Ontario)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 1995 (Halifax, Nova Scotia)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2002 (Kananaskis, Alberta)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2010 (Muskoka, Ontario) and a G20 meeting was held in Toronto that same year</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2018 (Charlevoix, Quebec)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the <strong>seventh time</strong> Canada is the <strong>President of the G7,</strong> and it will be held <strong>from January 1, 2025, to December 31, 2025</strong>. The highlight of this presidency will be the meeting between the leaders of the seven countries, which takes place <strong>from</strong> <strong>June 15 to 17 </strong>in Kananaskis, Alberta.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This year also marks the 50th year since the first G7 meeting hosted by France in 1975. For 50 years, the G7 has played an important role in raising global awareness, fostering collaboration, and promoting international action to address the most pressing challenges of the day.  </p>

<summary class="s-3ce6b948">G7 stakeholders</summary>
<p class="s-d3a86f53"><strong>BRAINSTORMING ACTIVITY: The G7 and you</strong></p>
<p>Your teacher will ask you to think about the various roles played by the stakeholders taking part in the G7. Here is a list of people who work to make the summit a success. Which role(s) can you see yourself in?</p>
<h3 class="s-6cfe161a">The Leaders</h3>
<p><span class="p">(role that the student can play during the simulation)</span></p>
<p>The leaders of the seven-member countries are the G7 Summit’s main stakeholders. Depending on how each country’s government is made up, it is either the head of state or the head of government who represents the country at G7 summits.</p>
<h3 class="s-6cfe161a">The Ministers</h3>
<p><span class="p">(role that the student can play during the simulation)</span></p>
<p>Finance and foreign affairs ministers also take part in the G7, often in the context of the preparatory meetings. Based on the themes chosen, other ministers may also attend the Summit or be involved in its preparation. For example, every year in the lead-up to the G7 Summit, Environment ministers (since 1994) and labour ministers (since 1996) have taken part in ministerial meetings.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>G7 <strong>employment and innovation ministers</strong> will meet under the theme of preparing for jobs of the future in the global context</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>G7 <strong>foreign affairs and security ministers</strong> will meet under the theme of building a more peaceful and secure world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>G7 <strong>environment and energy ministers</strong> will meet under the theme of working together for the environment</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="s-a1d359d7">The Sherpas</h3>
<p>(role that the student can play during the simulation)</p>
<p>The term “sherpa” refers to the personal representative of each G7 leader. Every year, in preparation for and during the summit, the sherpas for all the countries meet on a regular basis to agree on the agenda, how the summit will be organized and the final statement. They also meet after the summit for an update on how the announced commitments are being implemented. This year, the sherpas are meeting four times before the summit.</p>
<p>The sherpa for the host country is responsible for organizing and planning the event, the budget, logistics, collaboration between the different countries, communication and G7 awareness raising.</p>
<h3 class="s-6cfe161a">The Expert</h3>
<p>(role that the student can play during the simulation)</p>
<p>Expert and working groups made up of representatives from each country, and whose areas of expertise correspond with each of the chosen themes, also meet before and after the summits. For example, the Lyon Group on International Crime was created during the 1996 summit. During Italy’s 2017 G7 Presidency, the Lyon Group’s objective was to formulate strategies to combat terrorism and transnational crime. One of the topics discussed was dialogue between</p>
<p>religious communities to eliminate the negative impacts of socio-economic exclusion. The experts also hold discussions with civil society organizations to hear their recommendations.</p>
<h3 class="s-6cfe161a">Additional Roles in a G7 Summit</h3>
<h3 class="s-6cfe161a">The European Union</h3>
<p>The European Union is a full member of the G7. The President of the European Commission has attended the G7 Summit since 1977 (formally the European Economic Community) and the President of the European Council has attended since 1982. Although the European Union takes part in the G7 Summit every year (and has a sherpa and a delegation), in general, it does not host summits itself.</p>
<h3 class="s-6cfe161a">Invited Countries</h3>
<p>Every year, the G7 invites several countries to attend the Summit. For example, the African Union, Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, India, Jordan, Kenya, Mauritania, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Ukraine, the Vatican, and seven other countries were invited to the 2024 G7 in Apulia, Italy. The invited countries are usually chosen based on the themes to be addressed.</p>
<h3 class="s-6cfe161a">International Organizations</h3>
<p>Many international organizations attend G7-related activities, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The World Bank</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The United Nations (UN)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The World Trade Organization (WTO)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="s-6cfe161a">The Media</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The media are key G7 stakeholders. They keep the public informed on the Summit’s progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only a few hundred journalists attended the first summit in 1975, but today, the G7 Summits are attended by several thousand. Around 2,000 journalists are expected to attend the 2025 G7 Summit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This year, the International Media Centre will be located at the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity. Although the Summit is taking place in Kananaskis, sound, videos and images will be captured and broadcast in real time to the journalists in the city of Banff.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="s-6cfe161a">Civil Society</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Civic engagement groups</strong> will attend informal meetings. As such, civil society organizations like pressure groups and non-governmental organizations get together during the G7. Thematic groups include Women 7 (to discuss women’s issues), Labour 7 (employment issues), Science 7, Youth 7 (youth issues) and Business 7 (business issues). These groups give civil society the opportunity to meet with representatives and experts from G7 countries. These organizations put forward their recommendations based on that year’s themes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Researchers and professors</strong> from the academic community are sometimes consulted when the G7 agenda is being developed. They can also play an informal role in the G7 by holding side events or by speaking with the media.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>public will be able to share their opinions and visions for the G7 themes at information sessions held across Canada</strong>. Information and discussion meetings with the Canadian Sherpa are held across the country. Social media platforms are also places where people can share their opinions and points of view. On the margins of the official meetings, G7 summits have often been an opportunity for people and civil society groups to demonstrate and express their concerns about certain issues. In recent years, several demonstrations have taken place during the G7 (notably) to denounce economic inequalities around the world.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>[1] The phrases “countries with the most advanced economies,” “most industrialized countries,” “most powerful countries” and “most developed countries” are often used to describe the G7 countries.</p>
<p>[2] In a parliamentary system, the government, which holds executive power, can be overthrown by the parliament, to which it is politically accountable. Government members are not elected but come from the parliamentary majority to which they owe their power.</p>

<p class="s-21bbcb67">This educational workbook was developed as a guide for students to prepare for their participation in the 2025 Model G7 Summit on May 15, 2025. It was based on the workbook developed in 2018 by Claire Magonoux and Camille Marquis-Bissonnette (in close collaboration with Aurore Ménard and Nathalie Potvin) for the Model G7 of that year. The 2025 version was adapted by Alexandra Raymond for Global Affairs Canada’s Summits Management Office, under the supervision of Catherine Gohier and Christopher Robinson. Presented to the public in April 2025.</p>
